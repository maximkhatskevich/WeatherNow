The goal of this test is to develop a native iOS “weather” application which shows the user’s location on an interactive map with the current weather.

Users should be able to double tap on any location on the map and see the current weather based on the selected coordinates.

Any free weather data provider can be used to supply the weather information (e.g. OpenWeatherMap API).

The app should consist of two screens:
1) The main screen that displays the map with current location
2) A second screen which will be opened when the user double taps on a location, which will display the current weather information for the selected location.

Optional: the app should work in offline mode, to display the cached weather information for previously selected location.
